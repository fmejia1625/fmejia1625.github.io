Thank you for taking the time to check out my project. It is a Michael Jordan-themed version of the popular game, Hangman. The technologies that I used for tis are as follows: 

* HTML
* CSS 
* JavaScript
* Photoshop for editing photos of Jordan. 
* dafont.com for generating custom font
* Font Squirrel for uploading my custom font via webkit
* Keepvid.id to download videos from youtube and convert into MP4
* favicon.i0 to create custom favicon

I used HTML to outline the framework of the game, placed everything within a single container and used ID tags that I would use heavily with JavaScript. 

In my app.js file, I listed my steps that I used to create each function that would enable a a part of the game to execute. I began simply by creating an array of words, assigning to a variable, and then creating a function that would select a random word to display based on its index position in the araray. From there, I created functions for the virutal keyboard, the reset button and for cycling through different images of Jordan based on the number of guesses. 

I used CSS to added a video background, font styling and colors to match those of the Chicago Bulls and added music which can be toggled on and off. 

I had difficulty allocating for spaces between words, therefore each word that is used in the game contains no spaces. There are also no numbers used, and each word is based on the game of basketball or Jordan's accomplishments. 
Other difficulties I had included uploading my website to GitHub Pages due to the file size being larger than 25MB. This is most likely from the video that I used for the background of my game. If there is any way that I am able to host it through a different route, I would love to know. 

Finally, on GitHub pages, it seems as if my two images do not appear when first opening the website. Playing the game and then clicking on reset seems to fix this issue. Also, there is no audio of the song I included for the game. 

Feel free to make any comments or addresss your concerns.
